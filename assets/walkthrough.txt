Approach
Start by organizing your project into a directory. Create separate files for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This separation helps maintain a clean and modular codebase.
In your HTML File create an input tag to take the input file and also create a button to export the file.
Enhance the user interface by applying CSS styles. Utilize CSS rules to control the appearance of elements. Proper styling enhances user experience and makes the application visually appealing. Create a separate styles.css file for this purpose.
In your JavaScript file (script.js), define a function for exporting data to a CSV file. This function should take the data you want to export and convert it into CSV format. Use JavaScript's File API or libraries like Parse for CSV handling.
Implement JavaScript logic for importing data from a CSV file. When a user uploads a CSV file, your code should be able to read and parse the file. Again, libraries like PapaParse can simplify this process.
Create a button in the export section of your HTML that users can click to initiate the export process. Attach an event listener to this button that calls your export function when clicked.
Within your import and export functions, implement the logic for handling CSV data. For exporting, convert your data into CSV format, and for importing, parse the CSV data into a usable format for your application.
